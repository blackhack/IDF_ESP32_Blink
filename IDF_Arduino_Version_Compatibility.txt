Using Arduino as a component of IDF is extremely sensitive to version compatibility. Therefore, I will state the latest versions that, at the time of testing, are known to work:

IDF: 5.1.4 (https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/commit/e026fd1f81afc6d19561101b1c8fe0006932cff3)
Arduino: 3.0.4 (https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/commit/0539ebf322cf9b0620d4a8c357ddc284edc87f64)

Note: At the time of testing, the Rainmaker component had a build error. This can be easily fixed by manually applying one of the following pull requests until they are merged into the repository:

https://github.com/espressif/esp-rainmaker/pull/313/
https://github.com/espressif/esp-rainmaker/pull/297/
